{@linkplain com.zigabyte.stock.stratplot.StrategyPlotter StrategyPlotter}
provides a user interface for simulating a daily trading strategy,
such as {@link com.zigabyte.stock.strategy.SundayPeaks SundayPeaks}, 
over a historical set of data, plotting the progress, logging the
trades, and reporting on the result. <p>

Before running StrategyPlotter, 
<ol>
<li>Download and unzip data in Metastock format
    (if you haven't already).<p>
<li>Download and unzip the JFreeChart library from
    <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart">http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart</a>
    (if you haven't already).  Tested with JFreeChart-0.9.21
<li>Find the Stratplot.cmd or Stratplot.sh command file.
<li>Edit the command file to set JFCDIR
    to the directory where JFreeChart is installed.
</ol>

To run, execute the command script appropriate for your system:
<pre>
  Stratplot.cmd
</pre>
or
<pre>
  Stratplot.sh
</pre>
In the window, enter or browse to the path to the data, select its
format, and click "Load".<p>

Set the parameters and strategy, then click "Run" to run the strategy
over the data.  Adjust parameters and run again.  The strategy class
is reloaded for each run, so it may be changed and recompiled outside this
program, and the changed version will be loaded in the next run.<p>

During a run, the plot shows the progress of the account compared to
an index such as the S&amp;P500 ($SP or SPY).  The monthly log
summarizes the account value each month.  The trade log shows each
trade executed or cancelled.<p>

The simulation produces a final report something like the following:
<pre>
  Data:     /Trading Data/Stocks
  Dates:    01Jun2004 - 24Sep2004
  Strategy: SundayPeaks(0.2)

  Initial value:                          $10,000.00
    Cash Remaining:          $502.18
    Stock remaining:       $9,693.99
  Final value:                            $10,196.17
  Total Profit/Loss:                         $196.17

  Winning positions remaining:       5
    Average winning position profit:          $62.25

  Winning trade count:               3
    Average winning trade profit:             $62.39
  Losing trade count:                3
    Average losing trade loss:              -$100.75

  Winning Month Count:               2
    Best Month   (began 01Jun2004):          $607.24
  Losing Month Count:                2
    Worst Month  (began 01Jul2004):         -$340.87

  Beta vs. $SP:                      7.074
</pre>
Parsing the full data is time consuming, so there is a utility to
preparse the data:
<pre>
  Serialize.cmd -metastock /Trading Data/Stocks
</pre>
This produces the file
<pre>
  /Trading Data/Stocks.ser.gz
</pre>
With this file, run Stratplot as
<pre>
  Stratplot.cmd -serializedgz /Trading Data/Stocks.ser.gz
</pre>
To serialize data only during a certain period, use
<pre>
  Serialize.cmd -start-on 1Jan2004 -end-before 1Mar2004 -serializegz-to /Trading Data/StocksJanFeb2004.ser.gz -metastock /Trading Data/Stocks
</pre>
Serialized files will need to be regenerated if the stock data Java classes
change, so do not lose the original data.
